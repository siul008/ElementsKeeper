# ElementsKeeper
**ElementsKeeper** is a unique tower defense game developed in 1 week for a game jam based on the theme "**Shadows**" and "**Alchemy**". In this game, players can unlock and combine the **four base elements** (Fire, Wind, Water, Earth) to create powerful towers that defend against incoming waves of enemies. The goal is to survive three challenging waves by strategically using elemental combinations, such as combining Fire and Water to create a Steam Tower.

## Game Overview
ElementsKeeper is a tower defense game where players use elemental combinations to create towers with unique abilities. The game introduces a creative mechanic by allowing players to combine basic elements to craft specialized towers that will help them fend off waves of enemies. As players progress, they unlock more advanced elemental combinations, allowing for deeper strategies and tactical gameplay.

The game was developed in Unity and features homemade assets, including sound, visuals, and UI, to provide a unique and personalized gaming experience.

## Gameplay
- Elemental Combos: Unlock and combine Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth to create towers with unique abilities. For example, combining Fire and Water results in a Steam Tower, while other combinations may yield different effects like increased damage or splash damage.

- Tower Defense Mechanics: Place towers along the path to stop waves of enemies. Each wave grows increasingly difficult, so strategic placement, moving tower and combination of towers are key to survival.

- Three Waves to Victory: Survive three progressively challenging waves of enemies. Each wave introduces more complex enemy types, requiring thoughtful tower placement and combination to overcome.

## Features
- Elemental Tower Combinations: Combine base elements to unlock and create new types of towers with different attack abilities.

- Strategic Gameplay: Plan your tower placements and combinations carefully to fend off the enemies effectively.

- Wave-Based Challenge: Survive three waves of enemies, with increasing difficulty as you progress.

- Custom Assets: All game assets, including visuals, sound effects, and UI elements, are designed from scratch to give the game a unique and cohesive style.

- Alchemy and Shadows Theme: The game is built around the themes of Alchemy (through elemental combinations) and Shadows (Enemies are coming from the shadow and are shadows, the light slowly fades indicating the wave is coming and the game currency are void fragments), providing a deep thematic connection to the core gameplay mechanics.
